# Advanced-Machine-Learing
In this repository I collect projects developed in the academic setting for the Advanced Machine Learning course of the master's degree in Data Science.

## Assignment 1: Predicting Default Payments with Fully-Connected NNs.
The dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005. The goal is to predict payment defaults by developing a neural network.

## Assignment 2: Predicting grayscale images of letters P - Z.
The second assignment consists in the classification of letters from P to Z, by developing a neural network, starting from a dataset containing images of these letters. In addition it is necessary to develop an autoencoder, to extract the most important features from the training data.

## Assignment 3: Designing a CNN architecture and its formation.
The third assignment consists in the classification of numbers from 0 to 9, developing a convolutional neural network, starting from the MNIST dataset. Moreover there is a constraint in the number of parameters used: maximum 6000.

## Assignement 4: Transfer Learning using a CNN pretrained on IMAGENET.
The objective of this assignment is to perform transfer learning using a Convolutional Neural Network pretrained on the well-known IMAGENET dataset. The chosen task is the classification of images in 4 classes: neutrophil, eosinophil, monocyte and lymphocyte. The dataset is available on kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/blood-cells
